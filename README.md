# GCOVRReportMerger
Merges GCOVR XML reports.

Was originally going to be an attempt at merging Corbertura reports while learning Perl OO.

I then discovered that lcov can merge it's own files together (And in fact be used throught the 
whoel process of coverage gathering with GCOV). On other words, this was a waste of time (kind of).

I definitely learned it was a bad idea. Who in their right mind attempts OO in Perl?
